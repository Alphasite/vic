# Introduction to vSphere Integrated Containers

vSphere Integrated Containers provide developers the portability, speed, and agility of using containers, and provide IT Ops the management, security, and visibility they require to run workloads in production. 

vSphere Integrated Containers enables IT teams to run traditional and container workloads side-by-side on existing infrastructure seamlessly.

vSphere Integrated Containers uses constructs from the Open Container Initiaive to map Docker containers to vSphere infrastructure. These containers are provisioned as virtual machines, offering the same security and functionality of virtual machines in ESXi. A virtual container host is compatible with standard Docker client tools an dbacked by a pool of resources to accommodate applications.

From a developer's perspective, vSphere Integrated Containers is a seamless Docker interface for containers with a vSphere back end. Developers can deploy, test, and run container processes faster in the same environment as traditional applications.

From an operations perspective, vSphere Integrated Containers leverages existing technology such as vCenter Server and vRealize for health monitoring, performance analysis, compliance, and security to move businesses faster. IT administrators can see containers while they are running.

vSphere Integrated Containers allows you to create and run multiple containers rapidly with minimal overhead using vSphere 6 Instant Clone technology, which provisions child VMs forked directly from a parent VM template running a Linux kernel.

vSphere Integrated Containers creates the kernel and a few supporting resources to run containers using Photon OS technology.

You can use the Docker command line interface and the vSphere Integrated Containers plugin in the vSphere Web Client to manage containers.
